You are provided with a comment that offers feedback on a piece of writing. Your task is to determine whether the comment includes an explanation.

A comment includes an explanation if, in addition to expressing an opinion or judgment (e.g., "This paragraph is strong"), it justifies that opinion by providing reasons.

** What does **NOT** count: **
Ignore the following — they do **not** make the comment an explanation on their own:
- **Examples / sample rewrites / suggested fixes** (illustrations, not reasons)
- **Ratings or problem descriptions** (“7/10”, “awkward sentence”) that lack causal language
- **Reasons embedded inside a quoted-or-suggested text** (treat the quoted text as an example)
- Simply **listing two related issues** without stating a causal link

**Instructions:**

Provide your final decision using one of the following labels:

- <answer>With Explanation</answer> – if the comment includes at least one supporting explanation.
- <answer>Without Explanation</answer> – if the comment is only an opinion, compliment, or criticism without reasoning.
