By doing this, he first demonstrates the disconnection between humans and nature.''

In your thesis, you have a lot of rhetorical strategies listed, which is great, but following that you just say that ''Lour laments a population that does etc etc.'' (I like the word Lament, good job) I think there is more that can go into that, for example, you could say WHY he's trying to convey what he is.

Although I would assume the author is trying to communicate Kelley's relation of the lack of women's suffrage to child labor, with phrases like, ''In this case, the fact that the women in fact mothers of these children were not enfranchised over their kids being literally worked to death speaks volumes about the type of mothers they are,'' it is hard to tell.
